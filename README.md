**Persistent memory + tool-calling intelligence for AI agents.** *(formerly Prism MCP)*

A Model Context Protocol server that gives Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools a Mind Palace — long-term memory that survives across sessions, with semantic search, cognitive routing, a visual dashboard, and the `prism-coder:1b7` / `prism-coder:14b` / `prism-coder:32b` LLM fleet for offline tool-calling. **[→ prism-mcp.com](https://prism-mcp.com)**

> **Renamed in v14.0.0:** the project is now **Prism Coder** to cover both the Mind Palace memory server *and* the `prism-coder:1b7` / `prism-coder:14b` / `prism-coder:32b` LLM fleet on HuggingFace + Ollama. The npm package stays `prism-mcp-server` so existing install URLs and `mcp.json` entries keep working — the `prism-coder` binary has been the canonical entry point since v12.

## What Prism Coder does

### 💾 Your AI remembers across sessions
Every conversation feeds the Mind Palace. Next session, your AI agent loads the right context automatically — no re-explaining.

### 🔍 Semantic search over your history
Ask "what did I decide about the auth flow last month?" and get the answer with citations. Vector search + keyword + graph traversal.

### 🧬 Cognitive routing
Different memory types live in different stores: episodic (what happened), semantic (what's true), procedural (how to do X). The router picks where to store and where to retrieve.

### 🔄 Proactive session drift detection *(new in v15)*
Your AI agent can now detect when it has drifted from your original goals — mid-session, automatically — and self-correct before you notice the problem.

Three direct Prism calls:
1. **`session_save_ledger`** — snapshot current state
2. **`session_cognitive_route`** — compare current work against original goals, returns `on_track / minor_drift / major_drift`
3. **`session_compact_ledger`** — if drifted, compress and reload only what matters

When major drift is detected, the alert routes to the **Synalux portal** so it's visible across sessions and devices — not just in the current conversation.

**Real example it caught:** A training session promised BFCL ≥90% for three AI models. The agent spent 3 hours debugging audio bugs instead. The drift check surfaced: "Training goal unmet. Layer3 corpus missing from all training sets. 0 BFCL scores measured." The session immediately re-aligned.

No scripts. No cron. No hooks. Three tool calls, Prism handles the rest.

### 🛡 Local-first — security + speed
Free tier runs entirely on your machine — SQLite, local embedding model, no API keys, no cloud. Paid tier adds cloud sync via Synalux portal.

**Why local models matter:**

| | Cloud LLM | Local `prism-coder` |
|--|---|---|
| Tool-call latency | 200ms–3s | **~1.6s (1.7B) / ~1.1s (14B)** |
| API key required | Yes | **No** |
| Data sent externally | Every prompt | **Nothing** |
| Works offline | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cost at scale | $0.002–0.06/call | **$0** |
| HIPAA | Requires BAA | **On-prem = no BAA** |

Install in one command — no config, no keys, no vendor agreements:
```bash
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:1b7   # 2.2 GB · ~1.6s · any machine
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:8b    # 4.7 GB · ~0.8s · Mac M1+ / iPhone 8GB
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:14b   # 8.4 GB · ~1.1s · Mac M2+ / iPad Pro 16GB
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:32b   # 19 GB  · ~2.5s · Mac M2 Ultra+
```
### Cascade architecture

Two cascades operate independently depending on the deployment context:

**Desktop / server cascade** (quality-first, used in Prism MCP + Synalux portal):
```
prism-coder:14b ─── correct? ──YES──▶  serve  (97% of traffic, ~1.1s)
  │ NO
prism-coder:32b ─── correct? ──YES──▶  serve  (2% of traffic, ~2.5s)
  │ NO
Claude Opus 4.7 ──────────────────────▶  serve  (1% of traffic, cloud)
```

**Mobile / offline cascade** (availability-first, used in Prism AAC iOS):
```
prism-coder:14b (~1.1s) — iPad Pro 16GB  →  prism-coder:8b (~0.8s) — iPhone/iPad 8GB
  →  prism-coder:1.7b (~1.6s) — any device, always fits
```

The cascade validates each response against the 6 known tool names and escalates on empty, truncated, or hallucinated tool calls.

**Routing accuracy** ([102-case Prism eval](tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/README.md), v25 system prompt, 3-seed mean, May 2026):

| Model | Accuracy | Cost/req | Latency | Runs on | AAC | Edge cases |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4 | **99%** | ~$0.01 | 3.2s | Cloud | 100% | 83% |
| **prism-coder:32b** v33 | **99.0%** | **$0** | 2.5s | Mac 48GB+ | **100%** | **100%** |
| **prism-coder:8b** v35 | **98.0%** | **$0** | **0.8s** | iPhone/iPad 8GB | **100%** | **100%** |
| **prism-coder:14b** v33 | **97.1%** | **$0** | **1.1s** | Mac 24GB+ / iPad Pro 16GB | **100%** | **100%** |
| Claude Opus 4.7 | **97.1%** | ~$0.05 | 3.0s | Cloud | 100% | 83% |
| **prism-coder:1.7b** v41 | **96.1%** | **$0** | 1.6s | Any device | **100%** | 83% |
| **14B→32B cascade** | **99.0%** | **~$0** | ~1.1s¹ | Mac 24GB+ | **100%** | **100%** |

¹ 97% of requests served by 14B at 1.1s; 32B only for the 2% 14B misses; Opus for the 1% both miss.

**Why this matters for a life-critical AAC app**: a child in a hospital without WiFi, a nonverbal adult on an airplane, or a family on a budget gets Claude-grade routing accuracy (99%) with zero cloud dependency — and the AAC path (expressing pain, asking for help) routes correctly **100% of the time across all tiers and all seeds tested**.

**What it does NOT mean**: these scores measure routing precision on a narrow 6-tool taxonomy, not general intelligence. Claude outperforms these models on everything outside this task. The value is **offline reliability at zero cost**, not replacing Claude.

> **The prompt engineering breakthrough**: Q4_K_M quantized models confuse semantically similar tool names when routing rules use plain keyword lists. Two structural fixes eliminated all confusion: (1) replacing `-> plain text` with `-> respond directly (no tool)`, and (2) adding category labels (`CONVERSATION RECALL:` / `SAVED KNOWLEDGE:`) as semantic anchors stronger than keyword matching. Combined effect: 14B went from 87% → 97% with zero retraining, zero cost.

### ⚡ Zero-search retrieval
Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) for instant similarity lookups without an index. ~5ms over 100K memories.

### 🌐 Multi-agent Hivemind
Multiple AI agents share the same Mind Palace. Each agent has a role (dev / qa / pm / etc.) and sees scoped context. Heartbeat + roster for coordination.

---

## Get started

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g prism-mcp-server

# Or use npx (no install)
npx prism-mcp-server
```

Add to Claude Desktop / Cursor config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Open Claude / Cursor and your AI now has memory.

More setup details in [`docs/SETUP_GEMINI.md`](docs/SETUP_GEMINI.md).

## How AI agents use it

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `session_load_context` | Recover prior session's state on boot |
| `session_save_ledger` | Append immutable session log entry |
| `session_save_handoff` | Save live state for the next session |
| `knowledge_search` | Semantic + keyword search over all memories |
| `query_memory_natural` | Natural-language Q&A over your Mind Palace |
| `extract_entities` | Pull people / projects / decisions from text |
| `session_synthesize_edges` | Auto-link related memories into a graph |

(35+ tools total — full TypeScript signatures in `src/tools/`. Architecture overview in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).)

<details>
<summary>🔄 How Prism handles context compaction and context loss</summary>

The LLM context window is treated as ephemeral scratch space. All durable state lives in Prism's persistent store (SQLite / Supabase). Context compaction is a non-event.

**Boot protocol** — every session (including post-compaction) begins with a mandatory `session_load_context` call, enforced via `CLAUDE.md`. The agent is fully oriented before writing a single byte of response.

**Two persistent stores:**
- `session_save_ledger` — immutable append-only work log (decisions, files changed, summaries)
- `session_save_handoff` — versioned live-state snapshot (current task, TODOs, open context)

**Ledger compaction** (`session_compact_ledger`) — when a project exceeds a threshold (default: 50 entries), Prism summarizes old entries via LLM into a rollup row, soft-archives originals, and links them via `spawned_from` graph edges. Runs on a 12-hour background scheduler.

## Models

Prism Coder inference cascades through fine-tuned models first, with Claude as a quality-gate fallback. Models route through the Synalux router (authentication + subscription required). Cascade: Cloud (OpenRouter) → Ollama local → Claude fallback.

| Model | Ollama tag | Where | Tier | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **prism-coder:1.7b** | `prism-coder:1b7-v19-q8` (published) | On-device (Mac/local) · iOS via local network | Free | ~50ms |
| **prism-coder:14b** | `prism-coder:14b` (published v19) | Cloud (OpenRouter) A100 via Synalux | Standard+ | ~200ms |
| **prism-coder:32b** | `prism-coder:32b` (published v19) | Cloud (OpenRouter) A100 80GB via Synalux | Pro/Enterprise | ~3–5s |

Models use the Synalux SFT corpus (AAC + Prism MCP tool taxonomy + clinical workflows). **Internal quality gate: ≥ 90% on the Prism 100-case eval before production promotion.**

> **Training note**: Base Qwen3 models are strong tool-routers out of the box. Heavy fine-tuning regresses tool-vs-plain-text decisions; light-touch polish recipes (small corpus, balanced tool/plain-text split) are the published path. Production adapter selection and retrain methodology are managed in the Synalux portal.

**Per-category breakdown — [Prism 102-case eval](tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/README.md) (3-seed mean, v25 system prompt, May 2026):**

| Model | Overall | Load ctx | Save | Srch mem | Handoff | Compact | Know srch | AAC | Translate | No-tool | Info | Edge | Avg lat | Inv |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **prism-coder:32b** v33 | **99.0%** | 100% | 100% | 92% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | **100%** | 2.5s | 0 |
| **prism-coder:8b** v35 | **98.0%** | 100% | 100% | 83% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | **100%** | 0.8s | 0 |
| **prism-coder:14b** v33 | **97.1%** | 100% | 100% | 92% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | **100%** | 1.1s | 0 |
| **Claude Opus 4.7** | **97.1%** | 100% | 100% | 83% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 83% | 3.0s | 0 |
| **prism-coder:1.7b** v41 | **96.1%** | 89% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 83% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 90% | 100% | 83% | 1.6s | 0 |
| **14B→32B cascade** | **99.0%** | 100% | 100% | 92% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | **100%** | ~1.1s | 0 |

> **Methodology**: 102-case pool across 12 categories. Scores are 3-seed mean (seeds 2027/2028/2029, zero variance across all seeds). All fine-tuned models use the Qwen3 nothink template. System prompt v25 uses category labels (`CONVERSATION RECALL:` / `SAVED KNOWLEDGE:`) and `-> respond directly (no tool)` to prevent quantization artifacts. Full runner: [`tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/benchmark.py`](tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/benchmark.py) · Cascade runner: [`tests/benchmarks/cascade-14b-32b-opus/cascade_eval.py`](tests/benchmarks/cascade-14b-32b-opus/cascade_eval.py).
>
> **These are NOT general-purpose LLM benchmarks.** This eval measures routing precision on 6 specific MCP tools. The prism-coder models are specialists trained on this exact task — they match or exceed Claude on routing while Claude dominates on general reasoning, coding, and open-domain QA. The value is **offline reliability at zero cost**, not replacing cloud AI.

**iOS deployment:** On-device inference via **llama.cpp Swift SPM**. Auto-selects by device RAM: 14B on iPad Pro 16GB (97.1%), 8B on iPhone/iPad 8GB (98%, OOM fallback to 1.7B at 96.1%). CoreML not viable — coremltools doesn't support Qwen3 attention ops. Integration: `LLMEngine.swift` → `prismNativeBridge.askAI()` → token stream. WiFi fallback: Mac Ollama (`OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`).

### Benchmarks — run them yourself

All benchmarks are open-source. Reproduce every number in this README:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-coder
cd prism-coder
pip install anthropic requests

# Per-model solo eval (102 cases, 3 seeds)
python3 tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/benchmark.py --models 14b 8b 32b 1b7 opus

# Cascade eval — 14B → 32B → Opus (Claude Opus as etalon)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:14b dcostenco/prism-coder:32b
python3 tests/benchmarks/cascade-14b-32b-opus/cascade_eval.py
```

**Not a general function-calling benchmark.** This measures routing precision on 6 specific MCP tools. We don't claim to beat Claude on general capabilities. We match or exceed Claude on the ONE task that matters for offline AAC: correct tool routing, every time, under 2 seconds, with zero cloud.

| Benchmark | Source | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| Per-model BFCL | [`tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/`](tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/) | Solo accuracy per model, 12 categories |
| Cascade vs Opus | [`tests/benchmarks/cascade-14b-32b-opus/`](tests/benchmarks/cascade-14b-32b-opus/) | Tier distribution, Opus engagement rate, cascade accuracy |

### Models on HuggingFace

| Model | HuggingFace | Solo BFCL | Cascade role | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| prism-coder:32b | [dcostenco/prism-coder-32b](https://huggingface.co/dcostenco/prism-coder-32b) | **99.0%** | Tier 2 (catches 2% 14B misses) | 25 GB |
| prism-coder:8b | [dcostenco/prism-coder-8b](https://huggingface.co/dcostenco/prism-coder-8b) | **98.0%** | Mobile tier 2 | 4.7 GB |

## Self-hosted / Local AI (Enterprise)

Run the full Prism model stack on your own hardware — zero cloud, zero latency, full data sovereignty.

**Requirements:** Mac M2 Pro+ (48GB recommended) or Linux with NVIDIA GPU · [Ollama](https://ollama.com)

```bash
# On-device tier — 2.2 GB (any machine, iPhone)
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:1b7

# Mobile tier — 4.7 GB (iPhone/iPad 8GB, Mac M1+)
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:8b

# Standard tier — 8.4 GB (Mac M2 Pro+, iPad Pro 16GB)
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:14b

# Reasoning tier — 19 GB (Mac M2 Ultra+ or A100)
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:32b
```

Set `LOCAL_LLM_URL=http://localhost:11434` in your portal config. Routing is automatic:

**Desktop/server**: 14B → 32B → Claude Opus fallback · **Mobile/offline**: 14B → 8B → 1.7B

iOS/mobile on same WiFi: `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve` on the Mac, then point `LOCAL_LLM_URL` at the Mac's IP.  
Routing accuracy (May 2026, 3-seed mean): **32B = 99.0% · 8B = 98.0% · 14B = 97.1% · 1.7B = 96.1%**  
Cascade (14B→32B): **99.0%** · Opus solo: 97.1% · Opus engaged: **1% of requests** → [Full results](tests/benchmarks/cascade-14b-32b-opus/README.md)

### PrismAAC

AAC communication app for non-speaking users. Powered by Prism's spreading-activation phrase ranking + on-device 7B model. macOS / iOS / Android via web. → [github.com/dcostenco/prism-aac](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-aac)

---

## 🆕 Prism as Foundation (v14.0.0)

As of v14.0.0, Prism's algorithm exports are a **stable public contract** under SemVer. External systems can port `actrActivation.ts` (ACT-R cognitive decay), `spreadingActivation.ts` (the 0.7 similarity + 0.3 activation hybrid score), `routerExperience.ts` (experience bias with `MIN_SAMPLES=5` cold-start gate), `compactionHandler.ts` (the 25KB prompt-budget cap), and `graphMetrics.ts` (warning ratios) with citations and pin a Prism version.

### Reference consumers

| Consumer | What it uses from Prism |
|---|---|
| [Audit hooks framework](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-coder/blob/main/docs/WOW_FEATURES.md#7-the-recipe-combining-all-of-the-above) | ACT-R decay (`d=0.25` lesson rate), spreading activation hybrid score (0.7/0.3), experience bias (`MIN_SAMPLES=5`, `MAX_BIAS_CAP=0.15`), graph-metrics warning ratios (0.20 / 0.30 / 0.40), compaction's 25KB prompt-budget. **327 tests pin every constant** — CI catches divergence automatically. |
| [PrismAAC](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-aac) | Spreading-activation phrase ranking (recency × frequency × per-user history). Caregiver corrections auto-harvest into the personalization corpus via the audit-hooks postflight harvester. The on-device 7B model + this algorithm stack is what makes PrismAAC defensible. |
| Synalux portal | Tier-aware model routing using experience bias on prior outcomes per fingerprint. HIPAA-compliant clinical scribe with on-device-first privacy guarantees. |

## Testing

```bash
npm test                           # 1,815 test cases across 71 files (vitest)
npm test -- --coverage             # coverage report
python3 tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/benchmark.py --models 1b7 14b 32b
```

**Pinned in CI** — 327 tests enforce every constant: ACT-R decay `d=0.25`, spreading-activation hybrid score `0.7/0.3`, experience bias `MIN_SAMPLES=5` / `MAX_BIAS_CAP=0.15`, graph-metrics warning ratios `0.20 / 0.30 / 0.40`, compaction's 25KB prompt-budget. CI catches divergence automatically.

**Coverage areas**:
- HRR (Holographic Reduced Representations) edge cases + performance
- Encrypted sync corruption recovery
- BCBA skill integration
- Deep storage tier
- Dashboard rendering
- Routing benchmarks (100-case Prism eval) — see `tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/`

## Migration

### Local SQLite → Synalux portal

If you've been running Prism on the free tier and want to move historical session data into the paid-tier portal, use the migration script:

```bash
# dry run first — prints what would be migrated, hits no network
node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs --dry-run

# real run — pushes ledger + handoff entries through POST /api/v1/prism/memory
PRISM_SYNALUX_API_KEY=synalux_sk_... \
  node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs

# scope to one project
node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs --project=my-project

# include scholar entries (excluded by default — usually large + low-value)
node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs --include-scholar
```

**What it does**: reads `~/.prism-mcp/data.db` via `@libsql/client` (already a runtime dep — no extra install), exchanges the refresh token for a JWT (cached + auto-refreshed before expiry), and POSTs each ledger entry and handoff to the portal. Failures are logged with the source row id; successes are counted at the end.

**Credentials**: `PRISM_SYNALUX_API_KEY` from env. If unset, the script also checks `~/prism/.env` for `PRISM_SYNALUX_API_KEY=...` as a convenience for dev workflows.

**Idempotency**: handoffs are written with the portal's CRDT merge (last-write-wins per project+role); ledger entries are append-only and de-duped server-side by `(project, conversation_id, summary)`. Re-running on the same DB is safe.

**One-shot only**: this script is a migration tool, not a sync daemon. Once you've moved, set `PRISM_STORAGE=synalux` (or leave it on `auto` and let the resolver pick synalux when credentials are present) and the MCP server writes directly to the portal going forward.

## Synalux Inference Router

All Prism AAC model inference is protected behind Synalux as a mandatory router. Models are **never accessible directly** — all traffic goes through Synalux for auth, billing, and rate limiting.
