**Persistent memory + tool-calling intelligence for AI agents.** *(formerly Prism MCP)*

A Model Context Protocol server that gives Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools a Mind Palace — long-term memory that survives across sessions, with semantic search, cognitive routing, a visual dashboard, and the `prism-coder:1b7-v19-q8` / `prism-coder:14b` LLM fleet for offline tool-calling.

> **Renamed in v14.0.0:** the project is now **Prism Coder** to cover both the Mind Palace memory server *and* the `prism-coder:1b7-v19-q8` / `prism-coder:14b` LLM fleet on HuggingFace + Ollama. The npm package stays `prism-mcp-server` so existing install URLs and `mcp.json` entries keep working — the `prism-coder` binary has been the canonical entry point since v12.

## What Prism Coder does

### 💾 Your AI remembers across sessions
Every conversation feeds the Mind Palace. Next session, your AI agent loads the right context automatically — no re-explaining.

### 🔍 Semantic search over your history
Ask "what did I decide about the auth flow last month?" and get the answer with citations. Vector search + keyword + graph traversal.

### 🧬 Cognitive routing
Different memory types live in different stores: episodic (what happened), semantic (what's true), procedural (how to do X). The router picks where to store and where to retrieve.

### 🔄 Proactive session drift detection *(new in v15)*
Your AI agent can now detect when it has drifted from your original goals — mid-session, automatically — and self-correct before you notice the problem.

Three direct Prism calls:
1. **`session_save_ledger`** — snapshot current state
2. **`session_cognitive_route`** — compare current work against original goals, returns `on_track / minor_drift / major_drift`
3. **`session_compact_ledger`** — if drifted, compress and reload only what matters

When major drift is detected, the alert routes to the **Synalux portal** so it's visible across sessions and devices — not just in the current conversation.

**Real example it caught:** A training session promised BFCL ≥90% for three AI models. The agent spent 3 hours debugging audio bugs instead. The drift check surfaced: "Training goal unmet. Layer3 corpus missing from all training sets. 0 BFCL scores measured." The session immediately re-aligned.

No scripts. No cron. No hooks. Three tool calls, Prism handles the rest.

### 🛡 Local-first — security + speed
Free tier runs entirely on your machine — SQLite, local embedding model, no API keys, no cloud. Paid tier adds cloud sync via Synalux portal.

**Why local models matter:**

| | Cloud LLM | Local `prism-coder` |
|--|---|---|
| Tool-call latency | 200ms–3s | **~1.6s (1.7B) / ~1.1s (14B)** |
| API key required | Yes | **No** |
| Data sent externally | Every prompt | **Nothing** |
| Works offline | ❌ | ✅ |
| Cost at scale | $0.002–0.06/call | **$0** |
| HIPAA | Requires BAA | **On-prem = no BAA** |

Install in one command — no config, no keys, no vendor agreements:
```bash
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:1b7   # 2.2 GB · ~1.6s · any machine
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:8b    # 4.7 GB · ~0.8s · Mac M1+ / iPhone 8GB
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:14b   # 8.4 GB · ~1.1s · Mac M2+ / iPad Pro 16GB
ollama pull dcostenco/prism-coder:32b   # 19 GB  · ~2.5s · Mac M2 Ultra+
```
### Offline cascade: 14B → 8B → 1.7B fallback

When the Synalux cloud is unreachable, the AAC app cascades through local models:

```
Synalux cloud (Claude Sonnet/Opus, 98-99%)
  ↓ offline
prism-coder:14b (98%, ~1.1s) — Mac / iPad Pro 16GB
  ↓ not loaded
prism-coder:8b  (96%, ~0.8s) — iPhone / iPad 8GB
  ↓ OOM or not loaded
prism-coder:1.7b (88%, ~1.6s) — any device, always fits
```

The cascade validates responses against the 7 known tool names and escalates on empty, truncated, or hallucinated tool calls.

**Routing accuracy** ([100-case Prism eval](tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/README.md), v27 system prompt + nothink template, 3-seed mean, May 15 2026):

| Model | Accuracy | Cost/req | Latency | Runs on | AAC | Know Search |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4 | **99%** | ~$0.01 | 3.2s | Cloud | 100% | 100% |
| **prism-coder:14b** | **98.0% ± 0.0%** | **$0** | **1.1s** | Mac 24GB+ / iPad Pro 16GB | **100%** | **100%** |
| Claude Opus 4.7 | **98%** | ~$0.05 | 3.0s | Cloud | 100% | 100% |
| **prism-coder:32b** | **97.3% ± 0.6%** | **$0** | 2.5s | Mac 48GB+ | **100%** | 100% |
| **prism-coder:8b** | **96.0% ± 0.0%** | **$0** | **0.8s** | iPhone/iPad 8GB | **100%** | 93% |
| prism-coder:1.7b | **88%** | **$0** | 1.6s | Any device | **100%** | 71% |

**Why this matters for a life-critical AAC app**: a child in a hospital without WiFi, a nonverbal adult on an airplane, or a family on a budget gets Claude-grade routing accuracy (98%) with zero cloud dependency — and the AAC path (expressing pain, asking for help) routes correctly **100% of the time across all tiers and all seeds tested**.

**What it does NOT mean**: these scores measure routing precision on a narrow 7-tool taxonomy, not general intelligence. Claude outperforms these models on everything outside this task. The value is **offline reliability at zero cost**, not replacing Claude.

> **The prompt engineering breakthrough**: Q4_K_M quantized models confuse semantically similar tool names when routing rules use plain keyword lists. Two structural fixes eliminated all confusion: (1) replacing `-> plain text` with `-> respond directly (no tool)`, and (2) adding category labels (`CONVERSATION RECALL:` / `SAVED KNOWLEDGE:`) as semantic anchors stronger than keyword matching. Combined effect: 14B went from 87% → 98% with zero retraining, zero cost.

### ⚡ Zero-search retrieval
Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) for instant similarity lookups without an index. ~5ms over 100K memories.

### 🌐 Multi-agent Hivemind
Multiple AI agents share the same Mind Palace. Each agent has a role (dev / qa / pm / etc.) and sees scoped context. Heartbeat + roster for coordination.

---

## Get started

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g prism-mcp-server

# Or use npx (no install)
npx prism-mcp-server
```

Add to Claude Desktop / Cursor config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Open Claude / Cursor and your AI now has memory.

More setup details in [`docs/SETUP_GEMINI.md`](docs/SETUP_GEMINI.md).

| `extract_entities` | Pull people / projects / decisions from text |
| `session_synthesize_edges` | Auto-link related memories into a graph |

(35+ tools total — full TypeScript signatures in `src/tools/`. Architecture overview in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).)

<details>
<summary>🔄 How Prism handles context compaction and context loss</summary>

The LLM context window is treated as ephemeral scratch space. All durable state lives in Prism's persistent store (SQLite / Supabase). Context compaction is a non-event.

**Boot protocol** — every session (including post-compaction) begins with a mandatory `session_load_context` call, enforced via `CLAUDE.md`. The agent is fully oriented before writing a single byte of response.

**Two persistent stores:**
- `session_save_ledger` — immutable append-only work log (decisions, files changed, summaries)
- `session_save_handoff` — versioned live-state snapshot (current task, TODOs, open context)

**Ledger compaction** (`session_compact_ledger`) — when a project exceeds a threshold (default: 50 entries), Prism summarizes old entries via LLM into a rollup row, soft-archives originals, and links them via `spawned_from` graph edges. Runs on a 12-hour background scheduler.

## Models

Prism Coder inference cascades through fine-tuned models first, with Claude as a quality-gate fallback. Models route through the Synalux router (authentication + subscription required). Cascade: Cloud (OpenRouter) → Ollama local → Claude fallback.

| Model | Ollama tag | Where | Tier | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **prism-coder:1.7b** | `prism-coder:1b7-v19-q8` (published) | On-device (Mac/local) · iOS via local network | Free | ~50ms |
| **prism-coder:14b** | `prism-coder:14b` (published v19) | Cloud (OpenRouter) A100 via Synalux | Standard+ | ~200ms |
| **prism-coder:32b** | `prism-coder:32b` (published v19) | Cloud (OpenRouter) A100 80GB via Synalux | Pro/Enterprise | ~3–5s |

Models use the Synalux SFT corpus (AAC + Prism MCP tool taxonomy + clinical workflows). **Internal quality gate: ≥ 90% on the Prism 100-case eval before production promotion.**

> **Training note**: Base Qwen3 models are strong tool-routers out of the box. Heavy fine-tuning regresses tool-vs-plain-text decisions; light-touch polish recipes (small corpus, balanced tool/plain-text split) are the published path. Production adapter selection and retrain methodology are managed in the Synalux portal.

**Per-category breakdown — [Prism 100-case eval](tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/README.md) (3-seed mean, v27 system prompt + nothink template, May 15 2026):**

| Model | Overall | Load ctx | Save | Srch mem | Handoff | Compact | Web srch | Know srch | AAC | Translate | Plain txt | No-tool | Info | Edge | Avg lat | Inv |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sonnet 4** (cloud) | **99%** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 83% | 3.2s | 0 |
| **prism-coder:14b** | **98.0%** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 87% | 100% | 100% | **100%** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 82% | 1.1s | 0 |
| **Opus 4.7** (cloud) | **98%** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 66% | 3.0s | 0 |
| **prism-coder:32b** | **97.3%** | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 85% | 83% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 2.5s | 0 |
| **prism-coder:8b** | **96.0%** | 100% | 99% | 97% | 93% | 100% | 100% | 93% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 80% | 0.8s | 0 |
| **prism-coder:1.7b** | **88%** | 100% | 77% | 100% | 87% | 100% | 86% | 71% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 83% | 80% | 64% | 1.6s | 0 |

> **Methodology**: 100 prompts from a 200-pool across 13 categories. Scores are 3-seed mean (seeds 2027/2028/2029). 14B showed **zero variance**; 32B and 1.7B varied by ±0.6%. All models use the `nothink` template. System prompt v27 uses category labels (`CONVERSATION RECALL:` / `SAVED KNOWLEDGE:`) and `-> respond directly (no tool)` to prevent Q4_K_M quantization artifacts. Full runner: [`tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/`](tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/).
>
> **These are NOT general-purpose LLM benchmarks.** This eval measures routing precision on 7 specific MCP tools. The prism-coder models are specialists — they approach Claude on this narrow task but would not compete on general reasoning, coding, or open-domain QA. The value is **offline reliability at zero cost**, not replacing cloud models.

**iOS deployment:** On-device inference via **llama.cpp Swift SPM**. Auto-selects by device RAM: 14B on iPad Pro 16GB (98%), 8B on iPhone/iPad 8GB (96%, OOM fallback to 1.7B at 88%). CoreML not viable — coremltools doesn't support Qwen3 attention ops. Integration: `LLMEngine.swift` → `prismNativeBridge.askAI()` → token stream. WiFi fallback: Mac Ollama (`OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0`).

### Prism Routing Benchmark — run it yourself

The benchmark is open-source. Reproduce every number in this README:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-coder
cd prism-coder

# Run the full eval (100 cases, 3 seeds)
for seed in 2027 2028 2029; do
  python3 tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/benchmark.py --models 14b 8b 32b 1b7 --seed $seed
done
```

**Not a general function-calling benchmark.** This measures routing precision on 7 specific MCP tools — the task these models were built for. We don't claim to beat Claude on general capabilities. We match Claude on the ONE task that matters for offline AAC: getting the right tool, every time, in 1 second, with zero cloud.

### PrismAAC

AAC communication app for non-speaking users. Powered by Prism's spreading-activation phrase ranking + on-device 7B model. macOS / iOS / Android via web. → [github.com/dcostenco/prism-aac](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-aac)

---

## 🆕 Prism as Foundation (v14.0.0)

As of v14.0.0, Prism's algorithm exports are a **stable public contract** under SemVer. External systems can port `actrActivation.ts` (ACT-R cognitive decay), `spreadingActivation.ts` (the 0.7 similarity + 0.3 activation hybrid score), `routerExperience.ts` (experience bias with `MIN_SAMPLES=5` cold-start gate), `compactionHandler.ts` (the 25KB prompt-budget cap), and `graphMetrics.ts` (warning ratios) with citations and pin a Prism version.

### Reference consumers

| Consumer | What it uses from Prism |
|---|---|
| [Audit hooks framework](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-coder/blob/main/docs/WOW_FEATURES.md#7-the-recipe-combining-all-of-the-above) | ACT-R decay (`d=0.25` lesson rate), spreading activation hybrid score (0.7/0.3), experience bias (`MIN_SAMPLES=5`, `MAX_BIAS_CAP=0.15`), graph-metrics warning ratios (0.20 / 0.30 / 0.40), compaction's 25KB prompt-budget. **327 tests pin every constant** — CI catches divergence automatically. |
| [PrismAAC](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-aac) | Spreading-activation phrase ranking (recency × frequency × per-user history). Caregiver corrections auto-harvest into the personalization corpus via the audit-hooks postflight harvester. The on-device 7B model + this algorithm stack is what makes PrismAAC defensible. |
| Synalux portal | Tier-aware model routing using experience bias on prior outcomes per fingerprint. HIPAA-compliant clinical scribe with on-device-first privacy guarantees. |

## Testing

```bash
npm test                           # 1,815 test cases across 71 files (vitest)
npm test -- --coverage             # coverage report
python3 tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/benchmark.py --models 1b7 14b 32b
```

**Pinned in CI** — 327 tests enforce every constant: ACT-R decay `d=0.25`, spreading-activation hybrid score `0.7/0.3`, experience bias `MIN_SAMPLES=5` / `MAX_BIAS_CAP=0.15`, graph-metrics warning ratios `0.20 / 0.30 / 0.40`, compaction's 25KB prompt-budget. CI catches divergence automatically.

**Coverage areas**:
- HRR (Holographic Reduced Representations) edge cases + performance
- Encrypted sync corruption recovery
- BCBA skill integration
- Deep storage tier
- Dashboard rendering
- Routing benchmarks (100-case Prism eval) — see `tests/benchmarks/prism-routing-100/`

## Migration

### Local SQLite → Synalux portal

If you've been running Prism on the free tier and want to move historical session data into the paid-tier portal, use the migration script:

```bash
# dry run first — prints what would be migrated, hits no network
node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs --dry-run

# real run — pushes ledger + handoff entries through POST /api/v1/prism/memory
PRISM_SYNALUX_API_KEY=synalux_sk_... \
  node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs

# scope to one project
node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs --project=my-project

# include scholar entries (excluded by default — usually large + low-value)
node scripts/migrate-local-to-portal.mjs --include-scholar
```

**What it does**: reads `~/.prism-mcp/data.db` via `@libsql/client` (already a runtime dep — no extra install), exchanges the refresh token for a JWT (cached + auto-refreshed before expiry), and POSTs each ledger entry and handoff to the portal. Failures are logged with the source row id; successes are counted at the end.

**Credentials**: `PRISM_SYNALUX_API_KEY` from env. If unset, the script also checks `~/prism/.env` for `PRISM_SYNALUX_API_KEY=...` as a convenience for dev workflows.

**Idempotency**: handoffs are written with the portal's CRDT merge (last-write-wins per project+role); ledger entries are append-only and de-duped server-side by `(project, conversation_id, summary)`. Re-running on the same DB is safe.

**One-shot only**: this script is a migration tool, not a sync daemon. Once you've moved, set `PRISM_STORAGE=synalux` (or leave it on `auto` and let the resolver pick synalux when credentials are present) and the MCP server writes directly to the portal going forward.

All Prism AAC model inference is protected behind Synalux as a mandatory router. Models are **never accessible directly** — all traffic goes through Synalux for auth, billing, and rate limiting.
