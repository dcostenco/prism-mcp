## Why Prism?

Every time you start a new conversation with an AI coding assistant, it starts from scratch. You re-explain your architecture, re-describe your decisions, re-list your TODOs. Hours of context — gone.

**Prism gives your agent a brain that persists.** Save what matters at the end of each session. Load it back instantly on the next one. Your agent remembers what it did, what it learned, and what's left to do.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start


Add to your MCP client config (`claude_desktop_config.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note on Windows/Restricted Shells:** If your MCP client complains that `npx` is not found, use the absolute path to your node binary (e.g. `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd`) or install globally with caution.

**That's it.** Restart your client. All tools are available. Dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`. *(Note: The MCP server automatically starts this UI on port 3000 when connected. If you have a Next.js/React app running, port 3000 might already be in use.)*

## ✨ The Magic Moment

> **Session 1** (Monday evening):
> ```
> You: "Analyze this auth architecture and plan the OAuth migration."
> Agent: *deep analysis, decisions, TODO list*
> Agent: session_save_ledger → session_save_handoff ✅
> ```
>
> **Session 2** (Tuesday morning — new conversation, new context window):
> ```
> Agent: session_load_context → "Welcome back! Yesterday we decided to use PKCE
>        flow with refresh tokens. 3 TODOs remain: migrate the user table,
>        update the middleware, and write integration tests."
> You: "Pick up where we left off."
> ```
>
> **Your agent remembers everything.** No re-uploading files. No re-explaining decisions.

        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-brave-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Migration

<details>
<summary><strong>Migrating Existing History (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI)</strong></summary>

Prism can ingest months of historical sessions from other tools to give your Mind Palace a massive head start. Import via the **CLI** or directly from the [Mind Palace Dashboard](#-mind-palace-dashboard) Import tab (file picker + manual path + dry-run toggle).

#### Supported Formats
* **Claude Code** (`.jsonl` logs) — Automatically handles streaming chunk deduplication and `requestId` normalization.
* **Gemini** (JSON history arrays) — Supports large-file streaming for 100MB+ exports.
* **OpenAI** (JSON chat completion history) — Normalizes disparate tool-call structures into the unified Ledger schema.

#### How to Run

**Option 1 — CLI:**

```bash
# Ingest Claude Code history
npx -y prism-mcp-server universal-import --format claude --path ~/path/to/claude_log.jsonl --project my-project

# Dry run (verify mapping without saving)
npx -y prism-mcp-server universal-import --format gemini --path ./gemini_history.json --dry-run
```

**Option 2 — Dashboard:** Open `localhost:3000`, navigate to the **Import** tab, select the format and file, and click Import. Supports dry-run preview. See the [dashboard screenshot](#-mind-palace-dashboard) above.

#### Key Features
* **OOM-Safe Streaming:** Processes massive log files line-by-line using `stream-json`.
* **Idempotent Dedup:** Content-hash prevents duplicate imports on re-run (`skipCount` reported).
* **Chronological Integrity:** Uses timestamp fallbacks and `requestId` sorting to ensure your memory timeline is accurate.
* **Smart Context Mapping:** Extracts `cwd`, `gitBranch`, and tool usage patterns into searchable metadata.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code — Lifecycle Autoload (.clauderules)</strong></summary>

Claude Code naturally picks up MCP tools by adding them to your workspace `.clauderules`. Simply add:

```markdown
Always start the conversation by calling `mcp__prism-mcp__session_load_context(project='my-project', level='deep')`.
When wrapping up, always call `mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_ledger` and `mcp__prism-mcp__session_save_handoff`.
```

> **Format Note:** Claude automatically wraps MCP tools with double underscores (`mcp__prism-mcp__...`), while most other clients use single underscores (`mcp_prism-mcp_...`). Prism's backend natively handles both formats seamlessly.

</details>

<details id="antigravity-auto-load">
<summary><strong>Gemini / Antigravity — Prompt Auto-Load</strong></summary>

See the [Gemini Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GEMINI.md) for the proven three-layer prompt architecture to ensure reliable session auto-loading.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Supabase Cloud Sync</strong></summary>

To sync memory across machines or teams:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PRISM_STORAGE": "supabase",
        "SUPABASE_URL": "https://your-project.supabase.co",
        "SUPABASE_KEY": "your-supabase-anon-or-service-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Schema Migrations

Prism auto-applies its schema on first connect — no manual step required. If you need to apply or re-apply migrations manually (e.g. for a fresh project or after a version bump), run the SQL files in `supabase/migrations/` in numbered order via the **Supabase SQL Editor** or the CLI:

```bash
# Via CLI (requires supabase CLI + project linked)
supabase db push

# Or apply a single migration via the Supabase dashboard SQL Editor
# Paste the contents of supabase/migrations/0NN_*.sql and click Run
```

> **Key migrations:**
> - `020_*` — Core schema (ledger, handoff, FTS, TTL, CRDT)
> - `033_memory_links.sql` — Associative Memory Graph (MemoryLinks) — required for `session_backfill_links`

> **Anon key vs. service role key:** The anon key works for personal use (Supabase RLS policies apply). Use the service role key for team deployments where multiple users share the same Supabase project — it bypasses RLS and allows Prism to manage all rows regardless of auth context. Never expose the service role key client-side.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Clone & Build (Full Control)</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-mcp.git
cd prism-mcp && npm install && npm run build
```

Then add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/prism-mcp/dist/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-key",
        "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "your-gemini-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Common Installation Pitfalls

> **❌ Don't use `npm install -g`:**
> Hardcoding the binary path (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node/23.x/bin/prism-mcp-server`) is tied to a specific Node.js version — when Node updates, the path silently breaks.
>
> **✅ Always use `npx` instead:**
> ```json
> {
>   "mcpServers": {
>     "prism-mcp": {
>       "command": "npx",
>       "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
> `npx` resolves the correct binary automatically, always fetches the latest version, and works identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Already installed globally? Run `npm uninstall -g prism-mcp-server` first.

> **❓ Seeing warnings about missing API keys on startup?**
> That's expected and not an error. `BRAVE_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_API_KEY` warnings are informational only — core session memory works with zero keys. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) for what each key unlocks.

## ✨ What Makes Prism Different


### 🧠 Your Agent Learns From Mistakes
When you correct your agent, Prism tracks it. Corrections accumulate **importance** over time. High-importance lessons auto-surface as warnings in future sessions — and can even sync to your `.cursorrules` file for permanent enforcement. Your agent literally gets smarter the more you use it.

### 🕰️ Time Travel
Every save creates a versioned snapshot. Made a mistake? `memory_checkout` reverts your agent's memory to any previous state — like `git revert` for your agent's brain. Full version history with optimistic concurrency control.

### 🔮 Mind Palace Dashboard
A gorgeous glassmorphism UI at `localhost:3000` that lets you see exactly what your agent is thinking:

- **Current State & TODOs** — the exact context injected into the LLM's prompt
- **Interactive Knowledge Graph** — force-directed neural graph with click-to-filter, node renaming, and surgical keyword deletion
- **Deep Storage Manager** — preview and execute vector purge operations with dry-run safety
- **Session Ledger** — full audit trail of every decision your agent has made
- **Time Travel Timeline** — browse and revert any historical handoff version
- **Visual Memory Vault** — browse VLM-captioned screenshots and auto-captured HTML states
- **Hivemind Radar** — real-time active agent roster with role, task, and heartbeat
- **Morning Briefing** — AI-synthesized action plan after 4+ hours away
- **Brain Health** — memory integrity scan with one-click auto-repair

![Mind Palace Dashboard](docs/mind-palace-dashboard.png)

### 🧬 10× Memory Compression
Powered by a pure TypeScript port of Google's TurboQuant (inspired by Google's ICLR research), Prism compresses 768-dim embeddings from **3,072 bytes → ~400 bytes** — enabling decades of session history on a standard laptop. No native modules. No vector database required.

### 🐝 Multi-Agent Hivemind
Multiple agents (dev, QA, PM) can work on the same project with **role-isolated memory**. Agents discover each other automatically, share context in real-time via Telepathy sync, and see a team roster during context loading.

### 🖼️ Visual Memory
Save UI screenshots, architecture diagrams, and bug states to a searchable vault. Images are auto-captioned by a VLM (Claude Vision / GPT-4V / Gemini) and become semantically searchable across sessions.

### 🔭 Full Observability
OpenTelemetry spans for every MCP tool call, LLM hop, and background worker. Route to Jaeger, Grafana, or any OTLP collector. Configure in the dashboard — zero code changes.

### 🌐 Autonomous Web Scholar
Prism researches while you sleep. A background pipeline searches the web, scrapes articles, synthesizes findings via LLM, and injects results directly into your semantic memory — fully searchable on your next session. Brave Search → Firecrawl scrape → LLM synthesis → Prism ledger. Task-aware, Hivemind-integrated, and zero-config when API keys are missing (falls back to Yahoo + Readability).

### 🔒 GDPR Compliant
Soft/hard delete (Art. 17), full export in JSON, Markdown, or Obsidian vault `.zip` (Art. 20), API key redaction, per-project TTL retention, and audit trail. Enterprise-ready out of the box.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Long-running feature work** — Save state at end of day, restore full context next morning. No re-explaining.

**Multi-agent collaboration** — Dev, QA, and PM agents share real-time context without stepping on each other's memory.

**Consulting / multi-project** — Switch between client projects with progressive loading: `quick` (~50 tokens), `standard` (~200), or `deep` (~1000+).

**Visual debugging** — Save UI screenshots to searchable memory. Find that CSS bug from last week by description.

**Team onboarding** — New team member's agent loads the full project history instantly.

**Behavior enforcement** — Agent corrections auto-graduate into permanent `.cursorrules` / `.clauderules` rules.

**Offline / air-gapped** — Full SQLite local mode + Ollama LLM adapter. Zero internet dependency.

**Morning Briefings** — After 4+ hours away, Prism auto-synthesizes a 3-bullet action plan from your last sessions.

## 🆕 What's New

### v6.5 — HDC Cognitive Routing ✅
> **Current stable release.** The Mind Palace gains a brain-inspired routing engine.

- 🧠 **Hyperdimensional Cognitive Routing** — New `session_cognitive_route` tool composes the agent's current state, role, and action into a single 768-dim binary hypervector via XOR binding, then resolves it to a semantic concept via Hamming distance. Three-outcome policy gateway: `direct` / `clarify` / `fallback`.
- 🎛️ **Per-Project Threshold Overrides** — Fallback and clarify thresholds are configurable per-project and persisted via the existing `getSetting`/`setSetting` contract (no new migrations).
- 🔬 **Explainability Mode** — When `explain: true`, responses include convergence steps, raw Hamming distance, and ambiguity flags for full auditability.
- 📊 **Cognitive Observability** — `graphMetrics.ts` tracks route distribution (direct/clarify/fallback), rolling confidence/distance averages, ambiguity rates, and null-concept counts. Warning heuristics for fallback > 30% and ambiguity > 40%.
- 🖥️ **Dashboard Integration** — Cognitive metrics card with route distribution bar, confidence gauges, and warning badges. On-demand "Cognitive Route" button in the Node Editor panel.
- 🔒 **Feature Gating** — Entire pipeline gated behind `PRISM_HDC_ENABLED` (default: `true`). Clean error + zero telemetry when disabled.

## ⚔️ How Prism Compares

Standard memory servers (like Mem0, Zep, or the baseline Anthropic MCP) act as passive filing cabinets — they wait for the LLM to search them. **Prism is an active cognitive architecture.** Designed specifically for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, Prism doesn't just store vectors; it manages the LLM's context window autonomously.

### 📊 Feature-by-Feature Comparison

| Feature / Architecture | 🧠 Prism MCP | 🐘 Mem0 | ⚡ Zep | 🧪 Anthropic Base MCP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Interface** | **Native MCP** (Tools, Prompts, Resources) | REST API & Python/TS SDKs | REST API & Python/TS SDKs | Native MCP (Tools only) |
| **Storage Engine** | **BYO SQLite or Supabase** | Managed Cloud / VectorDBs | Managed Cloud / Postgres | Local SQLite only |
| **Context Assembly** | **Progressive (Quick/Std/Deep)** | Top-K Semantic Search | Top-K + Temporal Summaries | Basic Entity Search |
| **Memory Mechanics** | **Ebbinghaus Decay, SDM, HDC** | Basic Vector + Entity | Fading Temporal Graph | None (Infinite growth) |
| **Multi-Agent Sync** | **CRDT (Add-Wins / LWW)** | Cloud locks | Postgres locks | ❌ None (Data races) |
| **Data Compression** | **TurboQuant (7x smaller vectors)** | ❌ Standard F32 Vectors | ❌ Standard Vectors | ❌ No Vectors |
| **Observability** | **OTel Traces + Built-in PWA UI** | Cloud Dashboard | Cloud Dashboard | ❌ None |
| **Maintenance** | **Autonomous Background Scheduler** | Manual/API driven | Automated (Cloud) | ❌ Manual |
| **Data Portability** | **Prism-Port (Obsidian/Logseq Vault)** | JSON Export | JSON Export | Raw `.db` file |
| **Cost Model** | **Free + BYOM (Ollama)** | Per-API-call pricing | Per-API-call pricing | Free (limited) |

### 🏆 Where Prism Crushes the Giants

#### 1. MCP-Native, Not an Adapted API
Mem0 and Zep are APIs that *can* be wrapped into an MCP server. Prism was built *for* MCP from day one. Instead of wasting tokens on "search" tool calls, Prism uses **MCP Prompts** (`/resume_session`) to inject context *before* the LLM thinks, and **MCP Resources** (`memory://project/handoff`) to attach live, subscribing context.

#### 2. Academic-Grade Cognitive Computer Science
The giants use standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Prism uses biological and academic models of memory: **TurboQuant** for extreme vector compression, **Ebbinghaus curves** for importance decay, and **Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM)**. This makes Prism vastly more efficient on a local machine than running a giant Postgres/pgvector instance.

#### 3. True Multi-Agent Coordination (CRDTs)
If Cursor (Agent A) and Claude Desktop (Agent B) try to update a Mem0 or standard SQLite database at the exact same time, you get a race condition and data loss. Prism uses **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) with CRDT OR-Maps** — mathematically guaranteeing that simultaneous agent edits merge safely. Enterprise-grade distributed systems on a local machine.

#### 4. The PKM "Prism-Port" Export
AI memory is a black box. Developers hate black boxes. Prism exports memory directly into an **Obsidian/Logseq-compatible Markdown Vault** with YAML frontmatter and `[[Wikilinks]]`. Neither Mem0 nor Zep do this.

#### 5. Self-Cleaning & Self-Optimizing
If you use a standard memory tool long enough, it clogs the LLM's context window with thousands of obsolete tokens. Prism runs an autonomous [Background Scheduler](src/backgroundScheduler.ts) that Ebbinghaus-decays older memories, auto-compacts session histories into dense summaries, and deep-purges high-precision vectors — saving ~90% of disk space automatically.

### 🤝 Where the Giants Currently Win (Honest Trade-offs)

1. **Framework Integrations:** Mem0 and Zep have pre-built integrations for LangChain, LlamaIndex, Flowise, AutoGen, CrewAI, etc. Prism requires the host application to support the MCP protocol.
2. **Managed Cloud Infrastructure:** The giants offer SaaS. Users pay $20/month and don't think about databases. Prism users must set up their own local SQLite or provision their own Supabase instance.
3. **Implicit Memory Extraction (NER):** Zep automatically extracts names, places, and facts from raw chat logs using NLP models. Prism relies on the LLM explicitly calling the `session_save_ledger` tool to structure its own memories.

> 💰 **Token Economics:** Progressive Context Loading (Quick ~50 tokens / Standard ~200 / Deep ~1000+) plus auto-compaction means you never blow your Claude/OpenAI token budget fetching 50 pages of raw chat history.
>
> 🔌 **BYOM (Bring Your Own Model):** While tools like Mem0 charge per API call, Prism's pluggable architecture lets you run `nomic-embed-text` locally via Ollama for **free vectors**, while using Claude or GPT for high-level reasoning. Zero vendor lock-in.

## Architecture

Prism is a **stdio-based MCP server** that manages persistent agent memory. Here's how the pieces fit together:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MCP Client (Claude Desktop / Cursor / Antigravity)      │
│                    ↕ stdio (JSON-RPC)                    │

│  │  Cloud: Supabase + pgvector                        │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│         ↕                                                │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Startup Sequence

1. **Acquire PID lock** — prevents duplicate instances per `PRISM_INSTANCE`
2. **Initialize config** — SQLite settings cache (`prism-config.db`)
3. **Register 30+ MCP tools** — session, knowledge, search, behavioral, hivemind
4. **Connect stdio transport** — MCP handshake with the client (~60ms total)
5. **Async post-connect** — storage warmup, dashboard launch, scheduler start (non-blocking)

### Storage Layers

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Session Ledger** | SQLite (append-only) | Immutable audit trail of all agent work |
| **Handoff State** | SQLite (upsert, versioned) | Live project context with OCC + CRDT merging |
| **Keyword Search** | FTS5 virtual tables | Zero-dependency full-text search |
| **Semantic Search** | TurboQuant compressed vectors | 10× compressed 768-dim embeddings, three-tier retrieval |
| **Cloud Sync** | Supabase + pgvector | Optional multi-device/team sync |

### Auto-Load Architecture

Each MCP client has its own mechanism for ensuring Prism context loads on session start. See the platform-specific [Setup Guides](#-setup-guides) above for detailed instructions:

- **Claude Code** — Lifecycle hooks (`SessionStart` / `Stop`)
- **Gemini / Antigravity** — Three-layer architecture (User Rules + AGENTS.md + Startup Skill)
- **Cursor / Windsurf / VS Code** — System prompt instructions

All platforms benefit from the **server-side fallback** (v5.2.1): if `session_load_context` hasn't been called within 10 seconds, Prism auto-pushes context via `sendLoggingMessage`.

## 📦 Product Roadmap

> **[Full ROADMAP.md →](ROADMAP.md)**

### v6.2: The "Synthesize & Prune" Phase ✅
Shipped in v6.2.0. Edge synthesis, graph pruning with SLO observability, temporal decay heatmaps, active recall prompt generation, and full dashboard metrics integration.

### v6.5: Cognitive Architecture (Primary)
Full Superposed Memory (SDM) + Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC/VSA) becomes the next major implementation phase, targeting compositional memory states and faster associative retrieval at scale.

### After v6.5: Future Tracks
- **v7.x: Affect-Tagged Memory** — Recall prioritization improves by weighting memories with affective/contextual valence, making surfaced context more behaviorally useful.
- **v8+: Zero-Search Retrieval** — Direct vector-addressed recall (“just ask the vector”) reduces retrieval indirection and moves Prism toward truly native associative memory.

## Limitations

- **LLM-dependent features require an API key.** Semantic search, Morning Briefings, auto-compaction, and VLM captioning need a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini) or equivalent provider key. Without one, Prism falls back to keyword-only search (FTS5).
- **Auto-load is model- and client-dependent.** Session auto-loading relies on both the LLM following system prompt instructions *and* the MCP client completing tool registration before the model's first turn. Prism provides platform-specific [Setup Guides](#-setup-guides) and a server-side fallback (v5.2.1) that auto-pushes context after 10 seconds.
- **MCP client race conditions.** Some MCP clients may not finish tool enumeration before the model generates its first response, causing transient `unknown_tool` errors. This is a client-side timing issue — Prism's server completes the MCP handshake in ~60ms. Workaround: the server-side auto-push fallback and the startup skill's retry logic.
- **No real-time sync without Supabase.** Local SQLite mode is single-machine only. Multi-device or team sync requires a Supabase backend.
- **Embedding quality varies by provider.** Gemini `text-embedding-004` and OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` produce high-quality 768-dim vectors. Prism passes `dimensions: 768` via the Matryoshka API for OpenAI models (native output is 1536-dim; this truncation is lossless and outperforms ada-002 at full 1536 dims). Ollama embeddings (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`) are usable but may reduce retrieval accuracy.
- **Dashboard is HTTP-only.** The Mind Palace dashboard at `localhost:3000` does not support HTTPS. For remote access, use a reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) or SSH tunnel. Basic auth is available via `PRISM_DASHBOARD_USER` / `PRISM_DASHBOARD_PASS`.
- **Long-lived clients can accumulate zombie processes.** MCP clients that run for extended periods (e.g., Claude CLI) may leave orphaned Prism server processes. The lifecycle manager detects true orphans (PPID=1) but allows coexistence for active parent processes. Use `PRISM_INSTANCE` to isolate instances across clients.
- **Migration is one-way.** Universal History Migration imports sessions *into* Prism but does not export back to Claude/Gemini/OpenAI formats. Use `session_export_memory` for portable JSON/Markdown export, or the `vault` format for Obsidian/Logseq-compatible `.zip` archives.
- **Export ceiling at 10,000 ledger entries.** The `session_export_memory` tool and the dashboard export button cap vault/JSON exports at 10,000 entries per project as an OOM guard. Projects exceeding this limit should use per-project exports and time-based filtering to stay within the ceiling. This limit does not affect search or context loading.
- **No Windows CI testing.** Prism is developed and tested on macOS/Linux. It should work on Windows via Node.js, but edge cases (file paths, PID locks) may surface.
