**Persistent memory + tool-calling intelligence for AI agents.** *(formerly Prism MCP)*

A Model Context Protocol server that gives Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools a Mind Palace — long-term memory that survives across sessions, with semantic search, cognitive routing, a visual dashboard, and the open-weights `prism-coder:7b` / `prism-coder:14b` LLM fleet for offline tool-calling (BFCL Gold Certified, 100 % JSON validity).

> **Renamed in v14.0.0:** the project is now **Prism Coder** to cover both the Mind Palace memory server *and* the `prism-coder:7b` / `prism-coder:14b` LLM fleet on HuggingFace + Ollama. The npm package stays `prism-mcp-server` so existing install URLs and `mcp.json` entries keep working — the `prism-coder` binary has been the canonical entry point since v12.

## What Prism Coder does

### 💾 Your AI remembers across sessions
Every conversation feeds the Mind Palace. Next session, your AI agent loads the right context automatically — no re-explaining.

### 🔍 Semantic search over your history
Ask "what did I decide about the auth flow last month?" and get the answer with citations. Vector search + keyword + graph traversal.

### 🧬 Cognitive routing
Different memory types live in different stores: episodic (what happened), semantic (what's true), procedural (how to do X). The router picks where to store and where to retrieve.

### 🔄 Proactive session drift detection *(new in v15)*
Your AI agent can now detect when it has drifted from your original goals — mid-session, automatically — and self-correct before you notice the problem.

Three direct Prism calls:
1. **`session_save_ledger`** — snapshot current state
2. **`session_cognitive_route`** — compare current work against original goals, returns `on_track / minor_drift / major_drift`
3. **`session_compact_ledger`** — if drifted, compress and reload only what matters

When major drift is detected, the alert routes to the **Synalux portal** so it's visible across sessions and devices — not just in the current conversation.

**Real example it caught:** A training session promised BFCL ≥90% for three AI models. The agent spent 3 hours debugging audio bugs instead. The drift check surfaced: "Training goal unmet. Layer3 corpus missing from all training sets. 0 BFCL scores measured." The session immediately re-aligned.

No scripts. No cron. No hooks. Three tool calls, Prism handles the rest.

### 🛡 Local-first
Free tier runs entirely on your machine — SQLite, local embedding model, no API keys, no cloud. Paid tier adds cloud sync via Synalux portal.

### ⚡ Zero-search retrieval
Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) for instant similarity lookups without an index. ~5ms over 100K memories.

### 🌐 Multi-agent Hivemind
Multiple AI agents share the same Mind Palace. Each agent has a role (dev / qa / pm / etc.) and sees scoped context. Heartbeat + roster for coordination.

## Get started

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g prism-mcp-server

# Or use npx (no install)
npx prism-mcp-server
```

Add to Claude Desktop / Cursor config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prism": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "prism-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it. Open Claude / Cursor and your AI now has memory.

More setup details in [`docs/SETUP_GEMINI.md`](../SETUP_GEMINI.md).

## How AI agents use it

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `session_load_context` | Recover prior session's state on boot |
| `session_save_ledger` | Append immutable session log entry |
| `session_save_handoff` | Save live state for the next session |
| `knowledge_search` | Semantic + keyword search over all memories |
| `query_memory_natural` | Natural-language Q&A over your Mind Palace |
| `extract_entities` | Pull people / projects / decisions from text |
| `session_synthesize_edges` | Auto-link related memories into a graph |

(35+ tools total — full TypeScript signatures in `src/tools/`. Architecture overview in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md).)

<details>
<summary>🔄 How Prism handles context compaction and context loss</summary>

The LLM context window is treated as ephemeral scratch space. All durable state lives in Prism's persistent store (SQLite / Supabase). Context compaction is a non-event.

**Boot protocol** — every session (including post-compaction) begins with a mandatory `session_load_context` call, enforced via `CLAUDE.md`. The agent is fully oriented before writing a single byte of response.

**Two persistent stores:**
- `session_save_ledger` — immutable append-only work log (decisions, files changed, summaries)
- `session_save_handoff` — versioned live-state snapshot (current task, TODOs, open context)

**Ledger compaction** (`session_compact_ledger`) — when a project exceeds a threshold (default: 50 entries), Prism summarizes old entries via LLM into a rollup row, soft-archives originals, and links them via `spawned_from` graph edges. Runs on a 12-hour background scheduler.

## Models

All Prism Coder inference uses **only fine-tuned Prism Coder models** — no Claude, no Gemini, no OpenRouter fallbacks. Models are exclusively accessible through the Synalux router (authentication + subscription required).

| Model | Where | Tier | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3-1.7B** (fine-tuned) | On-device — iOS CoreML / Android ONNX | Free | ~50ms offline |
| **Qwen3-14B** (fine-tuned) | RunPod A100 via Synalux | Standard+ | ~200ms |
| **QwQ-32B** (fine-tuned) | RunPod A100 80GB via Synalux | Pro/Enterprise | ~3–5s |
| **Qwen3-30B-A3B** (fine-tuned MoE) | RunPod via Synalux | Enterprise | ~2–3s |

Fine-tuned on the 3-layer corpus: AAC + BFCL tool-calling + clinical workflows. BFCL gate: ≥ 90% on all tiers before production promotion. Adapters stored at `dcostenco/prism-coder-*` (private HuggingFace).

**Eval results (private, May 2026):**

| Model | Tool-call accuracy | Gate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-1.7B (on-device) | **90.0%** (27/30) | ≥90% | ✅ Passed |
| Qwen3-14B (cloud) | pending | ≥90% | ⏳ Training |
| QwQ-32B (reasoning) | pending | ≥90% | ⏳ Training |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B (MoE) | pending | ≥90% | ⏳ Training |

Eval methodology: 30 natural-language tool-call prompts, exact tool name + valid JSON argument structure required. Private eval — model weights never leave Synalux infrastructure.

## 🆕 Prism as Foundation (v14.0.0)

As of v14.0.0, Prism's algorithm exports are a **stable public contract** under SemVer. External systems can port `actrActivation.ts` (ACT-R cognitive decay), `spreadingActivation.ts` (the 0.7 similarity + 0.3 activation hybrid score), `routerExperience.ts` (experience bias with `MIN_SAMPLES=5` cold-start gate), `compactionHandler.ts` (the 25KB prompt-budget cap), and `graphMetrics.ts` (warning ratios) with citations and pin a Prism version.

### Reference consumers

| Consumer | What it uses from Prism |
|---|---|
| [Audit hooks framework](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-coder/blob/main/docs/WOW_FEATURES.md#7-the-recipe-combining-all-of-the-above) | ACT-R decay (`d=0.25` lesson rate), spreading activation hybrid score (0.7/0.3), experience bias (`MIN_SAMPLES=5`, `MAX_BIAS_CAP=0.15`), graph-metrics warning ratios (0.20 / 0.30 / 0.40), compaction's 25KB prompt-budget. **327 tests pin every constant** — CI catches divergence automatically. |
| [PrismAAC](https://github.com/dcostenco/prism-aac) | Spreading-activation phrase ranking (recency × frequency × per-user history). Caregiver corrections auto-harvest into the personalization corpus via the audit-hooks postflight harvester. The on-device 7B model + this algorithm stack is what makes PrismAAC defensible. |
| Synalux portal | Tier-aware model routing using experience bias on prior outcomes per fingerprint. HIPAA-compliant clinical scribe with on-device-first privacy guarantees. |

## Synalux Inference Router — Architecture (v16)

All Prism AAC model inference is protected behind Synalux as a mandatory router. Models are **never accessible directly** — all traffic goes through Synalux for auth, billing, and rate limiting.
